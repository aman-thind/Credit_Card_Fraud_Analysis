<h1 align="center">Credit Card Fraud Analysis</h1>  
Objective: Prediction of credit card fraudulent transcations using Machine Learning.

The project aims to classify the fraudulent transactions of credit cards. The Credit Card Fraud Detection problem includes modeling credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turns out to be fraud. Such modeling will enable companies to efficiently flag a transaction which may be fraudulent.

## Dataset

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Due to confidentiality issues, the input variables are transformed into numerical using PCA transformations.
